[Cm]See your body into the moonlight
[Ab]Even if I [B]try to cancel
[Cm]All the pictures into the mind
There's a [Gm]flashing in my [Ab]eyes

@bridge
Don't you see my [Ab]commission, [B]the nation
[Gm]Has gone [Ab]running again
Can't you see now, [Ab]illusions
[B]Right into your [C]mind

@ch1
Deja  [Ab]Vu!
I've just [B]been in this [Cm]place before
Higher on the [Ab]street
And I [B]know it's my [F]time to go
Calling you, and the search is a mystery
Standing on my feet
It's so hard when I try to be me, [Gm]woah

@ch2
Deja Vu!
I've just been in this time before
Higher on the beat
And I know it's a place to go
Calling you and the search is a mystery
Standing on my feet
It's so hard when I try to be me, yeah

See the future into the present
See my past leaves in the distance
Try to guess now what's going on
And the band begins to play

See your body into the moonlight

There's a flashing in my eyes
