[Cm]See your body into the moonlight
[Ab]Even if I [B]try to cancel
[Cm]All the pictures into the mind
There's a [Gm]flashing in my [Ab]eyes

@bridge
Don't you see my [Ab]commission, [B]the nation
[Gm]Has gone [Ab]running again
Can't you see now, [Ab]illusions
[B]Right into your [C]mind

@ch1
Deja  [Ab]Vu!
I've just [B]been in this [Cm]place before
Higher on the [Ab]street
And I [B]know it's my [F]time to go
Calling [Ab]you, and the [B]search is a [Cm]mystery
Standing on my [Ab]feet
It's so [B]hard when I [F]try to be me, [Gm]woah

@ch2
Deja [Ab]Vu!
I've just [B]been in this [Cm]time before
Higher on the [Ab]beat
And I [B]know it's a [F]place to go
Calling [Ab]you and the [B]search is a [Cm]mystery
Standing on my [Ab]feet
It's so [B]hard when I [F]try to be me, [Gm]yeah

See the future into the present
See my past leaves in the distance
Try to guess now what's going on
And the band begins to play
