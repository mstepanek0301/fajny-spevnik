Out Of Range ~ Red Hot Chili Peppers

[Dsus2]

[Am]Leaving town I found a [F]flower that I [C]could deserve
Someone moves and someone's bound to get their feelings hurt
[G]I'm loving you, you're out of [Am]range [Em]
[G]Wanted you you're out of [Am]range [E]

As I walked out into the world I feel a sudden chill
I was bleeding put it good onto a daffodil
Loving you, you're out of range
Wanted to, you're out of range

@chorus
[Dm C G]I don't want too much more than
[C G]Than to be [Dm]re[Am]born
In [F]the [E]morning
Reborn so I can feel you
The thorns are blooming with ya
I feel you

[Am]I have your number and I [F]dialed it up a [C]hundred times
Barely there, your voice is crackin' up across state lines
[G]Loving you, you're out of [Am]range [Em]
[G]Wanted you, you're out of [Am]range [E]

Skies of ecstacy we're breaking well I do believe
The tears of God were falling down upon my swollen cheeks
Loving you, you're out of range
Wanted you, you're out of range

@chorus

[F]I know it [G]hurts when it's [C]taken [F]away
I tell you that [G]I could be [C]living
[Dm]Today with you or with[F]out you [Em]okay
[Dm]Washed by the rain and it's [F]all gonna [Em]change
