Fly Away ~ GloryHammer

[D]I wanna fly a[Gm]way on a [Eb]unicorn
To a [B]land of freedom and [F]light
But I [Gm]know that my [Eb]destiny
Is to [B]die in the ultimate [D]fight
I wanna fly a[Gm]way 'cross the [Eb]galaxy
To dis[B]cover the force that's in[F]side of [Eb]me [C D]
I wanna fly a[Gm]way

[Gm Cm D] (3x)

[Gm]I have discovered there's a world beyond Dundee
A vast eternal sea of [Eb]stars [D]
[Gm]I've crossed the wastelands from the mountains to the sea
My quest is neverending [D F A]

I wanna fly a[Dm]way on a [B]unicorn
To a [F]land of freedom and [C]light
But I know that my destiny
Is to die in the ultimate [A]fight
I wanna fly away 'cross the galaxy
To discover the force that's inside of [B]me [A]
I wanna fly a[Dm]way

[Dm B A]

[Dm]The crystal citadel of Cowdenbeath is mine
This astral hammer holds the [B]key
(Fragments [A]of a fallen [Dm]star)
For countless centuries we've walked the cosmic line
It's time to break the prophecy
(Anstruther's dark prophecy)
[B]By the power of this [Dm]amulet I wield
(This amulet I wield)
[B]I'll cross the threshold to a [Gm]universe of [A]steel

I wanna fly a[Dm]way on a [B]unicorn
To a [F]land of freedom and [C]light
But I know that my destiny
Is to die in the ultimate [A]fight
I wanna fly away 'cross the galaxy
To discover the force that's inside of [B]me [A]

I wanna fly a[B]way
On a quest that is calling me
To the [Dm]other side of the galaxy
I [C]know I'll find my destiny
In [A]outer space in 1993
Yeah!

I wanna fly [Em]away on a [C]unicorn
To a [G]land of freedom and [D]light
But I know that my destiny
Is the... Kingdom of [H]Fife
I wanna fly away 'cross the galaxy
To discover the force that's inside of [C]me [H]

I wanna fly away
I wanna fly away
I wanna fly away
Oh yeah
I wanna fly away!
