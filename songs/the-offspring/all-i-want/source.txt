All I Want ~ The Offspring

Okay! Ya ya ya ya ya!
[F#m] [D] [E] 2x

[F#m]Day after day (your home life's a wreck)
[F#m]The powers that be just breathe down your neck
[F#m]You get no respect (you get no relief)
[F#m]You gotta speak up and yell out your piece

[F#m]So back off your rules
[D]Back off the jive
Cause I'm [A]sick of not living 
[E]To stay alive
[F#m]Leave me alone
[D]Not asking a lot
I don't [A]wanna to be cont[E]rolled
That's all I [F#m]want[D]
That's all I [A]want[E]
That's all I [F#m]want[D]
That's all I [A]want[E]
Ya ya ya ya [F#m]ya!

[F#m] [D] [E] 2x
How many times (is it gonna take)
'Til someone around you hears what you say?
You've tried being cool (you feel like a lie)
You've played by their rules, now it's their turn to try

So back off your rules
Back off your jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone
Not asking a lot
Just don't wanna to be controlled
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want

I [D]said it [E]before
I'll [F#m]say it a[E]gain
If [D]you could just [E]listen
Then it [D]might make sen[H]se
So 

Back off your rules
Back off your jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone
Not asking a lot
Just don't wanna to be controlled
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
[E]Ya ya ya ya [F#m]ya!
